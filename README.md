## Introduction

As an individual class project for learning Power BI, I used data from [Dryad](datadryad.org) to analyze the history of migratory bird collisions into Chicago buildings by species and time of year.

## Inspiration

I found the dataset interested because I've been fedding birds in my backyard for over 20 years and have enjoyed observing the seasonal visitations of a few species at my feeder as they migrate.
